### Load the LEA Library ###
library(LEA)   # Provides tools for population genetics, specifically for estimating population structure

### Convert VCF to GENO Format for SNMF ###
output = vcf2geno("DP5g90maf05q30filteredHeLDpruned.vcf")    # Convert a VCF file to GENO format compatible with LEA and SNMF
# The output is a `.geno` file, which contains genotype data needed for the SNMF analysis

### Run SNMF for Population Structure Analysis ###
project = snmf("DP5g90maf05q30filteredHeLDpruned.geno",    # Input GENO file with pruned SNP data
               K = 1:18,                # Range of population clusters (K) to evaluate, from 1 to 18 clusters
               entropy = TRUE,          # Calculate cross-entropy for model selection
               repetitions = 10,        # Run each K value 10 times to assess stability
               project = "new",         # Create a new SNMF project with this analysis
               ploidy = 2)              # Set ploidy to 2 (for diploid organisms)

### Plot Cross-Entropy Values to Determine Optimal K ###
plot(project, cex = 1.2, col = "lightblue", pch = 19)
# Plot cross-entropy values across different K values to assess model quality:
# - `cex = 1.2`: Set point size for plot markers
# - `col = "lightblue"`: Use light blue color for points
# - `pch = 19`: Use solid circle markers for points

# The cross-entropy plot helps determine the optimal K value for population clustering by selecting the
